	solution breaks down for mx greater than 31 starts to predict an exponential growth in solution 
		(e52 at mx = 33) AT mt=1000
	increasing amount of timesteps tackles this  -> can go over mx=50 at mt = 10000
	THESE VALUES EFFECT THE VALUE OF LAMBDA -> stability criterion is that lambda must be less than 0.5
	kappa (diffusion constant) also effects lambda and can be used to enforce stability
	T effects the value of delta_t therfore can effect stability
	L effects delta_x
	lambda(kappa, delta_x, delta_t)
	delta_t(mx, L)		delta_t(mx, T)
	therefore lambda and therefore stability is a function of 
		(kappa, mx, L, mt, T)

	lamdba(kappa, mx, L, mt, T) : D * T/mt * (mx/L)**2
	In our case (for L=1, D=1, T=0.5, mt=1000) mx > 31 will break stability criterion and therefore
	solutions will be incorrect and display exponential growth.
